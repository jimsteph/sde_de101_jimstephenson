# What do data engineers do?
## Assignment: Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? How would you go about gathering requirements?
1. Figure out who the stakeholders are, i.e.: who will be the final users of the analytics.  The odds are that there isn't a single department in the company that couldn't make use of the products, so gather the names of one or two key members of each department.
2. Talk to those key members and get samples of the reports that they currently use.  This will include reports generated by other software packages, spreadsheets that are critical to their work, etc.
3. Find out the data source(s) for each report: is it raw data from a server, spreadsheets from another department, etc.  Find out how much of it is automated and how much has to be manually collated and processed.
4. Find out the pain points in their current reports: what takes too long, what is overly complex to generate, and especially what they want that isn't possible with their current set up.
